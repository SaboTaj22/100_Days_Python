#Coding Challenge 2

# Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
# Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight

#Leap Year Challenge 3

#Coding Challenge 4
# Congratulations, you've got a job at Python Pizza. Your first job is to build an automatic pizza order program.

#
# Medium Pizza: $20
#
# Large Pizza: $25
#

#
# Pepperoni for Medium or Large Pizza: +$3
#
# Extra cheese for any size pizza: + $1

#Logical Operators
# A and B = Either both True to be True, or if 1 of them is false overall false.
# C or D = If one or other is True, it evaluates to True. ONLY when C and D are both false does it evaluate to False
# not = Reverses the output. I.E. True to False and False to True.

# Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs.
#
# Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.

#Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡
# combined_names = name1 + name2 #first step is to add the names together then convert to lower so we can count input

#Level 3: Blue, Red, or Yellow Door?
